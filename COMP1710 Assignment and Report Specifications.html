					<h3>Report</h3>

					<p>The Report task involves COMP1710 students taking part in two or more
						Human-Computer Interaction research experiments which add up to 3 hours, an=
						d then writing a report on
						their experiences as experiment participants. In this report the students w=
						ill
						(i) describe the purpose of each experiment and their personal experience o=
						f
						taking part in the experiment, (ii) compare their experiences across the
						different experiments and (iii) write what they have learned about the rele=
						vance
						of participant-focused experiments like these to the overall process of des=
						igning
						and building a set of web pages.</p>

					<p>For most students, it's easier to write the report after having particip=
						ated in
						experiments, but its not compulsory to participate in experiments. If you d=
						o
						not wish to participate, you can instead be allocated papers to read and su=
						mmarise
						instead. Participation in experiments / reading-summarising is a hurdle ass=
						essment.
						We will use the Research School of Psychology's experiment management softw=
						are (SONA) for
						you to participate in experiments.</p>

					<hr>

					<h2 id=3D"part1">1.0 Part 1 Tasks </h2>

					<h3>1.1 Info and Review </h3>

					<p>The first step of the assignment is to fill in the assignment <a href=3D="http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp1710/info_form.html">info form</a>. The
						form does not work well in Internet Explorer! Please review the <a href=3D"=http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp1710/fairUse.html">Fair Use document</a> document to understand what is tolerable to do and what is strictly prohibi=ted in the
							context of this Assignment. </p> <h3>1.2 Introduce Yourself and/or Your Passion </h3>

							<p>Introduce yourself and/or your passion, interest or hobby etc. Write a
								mission statement or list of goals similar to the idea of a brief statement=
								of
								the mission and list of goals in chapter 1 of the <q>Unusually Useful Web
									Book</q>. This section should probably take 200-400 words or so. </p>

							<h3>1.3 Create a CSS </h3>

							<p>Create an external (separate) CSS file. Use at least 10 CSS rules. Make =
								sure
								your CSS includes comments that would be useful to someone taking over the
								maintenance of your site, things like the purpose of each rule, exceptions =
								to
								its use and the choice you made as to which selector you specified. </p>

							<p>If you create more than one CSS make sure they are deployed in a
								<q>Cascading</q> manner, i.e. there should be at least one default CSS that
								will be applied to all the pages in your site, with specialised CSS then be=
								ing
								applied to specific pages of the web site. </p>

							<h3>1.4 Build a Site Map </h3>

							<p>This page should clearly depict the organisation/structure of the web si=
								te,
								possibly using a table or links (or both) or an image map. <em>Make sure yo=
									u
									update the site map as you expand your web site in Parts 2 and 3.</em> </p>

							<h3>1.5 Provide a Source Log </h3>

							<p>You will need to keep a log. A typical log describes the list of sources=
								you
								used for your project and the modifications you applied to them. The origin=
								of
								the source should be given in enough detail to ensure the marker can access=
								the
								source whenever it is possible (URL, ISBN etc). <em>Make sure you update th=
									e
									source log as you expand your web site in Parts 2 and 3.</em> </p>

							<h3>1.6 Provide an opportunity for feedback </h3>

							<p>Create a page which takes feedback from visitors to your site via a form=
								.</p>

							<h3>1.7 Separate assignment page from passion pages</h3>

							<p>The top page of your website (passion pages) is the usual index.html.
								You will also include an assignment.html file that will be explained to you=
								in
								the first lab. Use and modify the assignment.html page which lists all the
								assignment requirements for this assignment, and make sure it provides
								direct links to your content. E.g. the source log or feedback page may
								not be relevant to your passion so you can avoid showing it to normal
								users coming in via the index.html page, but for marking purposes we
								need to find this content so it should be linked to from your
								assignment.html page. </p>

							<p>The choices you make can be briefly explained in your assignment.html pa=
								ge,
								but don't write too much there, as we are marking your web page for your
								passion and the assignment.html page is mainly to help us find all the
								components we want to mark.</p>

							<p>The MOOC materials and tasks have significant overlap with the Assignmen=
								t
								Part 1. You will need to add some extra components to the MOOC tasks and th=
								at
								is your Assignment Part 1.</p>

							<h3>1.8 Active Participation</h3>

							<p>Provide URL links to your three best Piazza posts.</p>

							<p></p>
							<hr>

							<h2 id="part2">2.0 Part 2 Tasks </h2>

							<p>In the second part of your assignment you will add content and possibly
							enhance your design. </p>
							
							<h3>2.1 Provide an Image Map </h3>
							
							<p>Create a page which displays one or more image maps. Make sure that there
							are at least 3 links, with proper labels in your image map. </p>
							
							<h3>2.2 Provide a Photo Gallery </h3>
							
							<p>Take or select at least 10 relevant photographs. Convert the photographs to
							*.png format. Use a template or a suitable tool like Galerie to present them
							with appropriate titles and any comments you wish to make. Your photo gallery
							should have the same look and feel as the rest of the web site. The easiest way
							to achieve this is to ensure it uses the same CSS. Or it may be appropriate for
							you to link to content stored elsewhere on the internet. </p>
							
							<h3 style="color:red;">2.3 &amp; 2.4 Videos or Javascript</h3>
							
							<p style="color:red;">For 2.3 and 2.4, you can choose either to develop a storyboard (2.3a) and a video (2.4a),
							  or write some javascript to add interactivity (2.3b and 2.3b). </p>
							
							<p style="color:red;">Please note that you <strong>WILL NOT</strong> get extra marks if you do both
							so please indicate which components you would like us to assess.</p>
							
							<h4>2.3a Develop a Storyboard (for your video) </h4>
							
							<p>Create a storyboard for your video as a comic (see the relevant lab). The
							  key thing is to present your plan of how you intend your video (see 3.1) to
							  look after editing. </p>
							
							<p>The comic and the video (see next task) should represent the same
							  <q>story</q>. It should be possible to understand the video by reading the
							  comic, and understand the comic by watching the video.</p>
							
							<h4>2.4a Make an edited, inline video </h4>
							
							<p>Shoot (or collect) and edit a video and present it on the website. The video
							  (i.e. about your subject, its the same video) should contain at least one title
							  and one transition. It will be inlined within a web page. Use your creativity
							  and originality to do something interesting, useful or just funny. </p>
							
							<p>For video cameras and especially digital still cameras with movie mode,
							  don't forget to use a tripod or video stabilisation. Keep in mind that video
							  cameras are not the only source of video. For example, many modern digital
							  cameras in <q>movie mode</q> will produce video recording which are fine for
							  web delivery. Then there is video capture from a running program, and so on.
							</p>
							
							<p>Last year almost everyone had access to a video camera or digital still
							  camera with movie mode from family / friends / church / work / etc. If you end
							  up unable to find someone with one, please e-mail me and I will try and help.
							</p>
							
							<p>I suggest 5 minutes absolute max for the final video. You should also
							  provide a few words on your site describing what the video is about and/or
							  trying to achieve. </p>
							
							<h4 style="color:red;">2.3b Javascript addition （optional INSTEAD of 2.3a）</h4>
							
							<p style="color:red;">We will be looking for an excellent JS addition to your website that complements
							  your theme.  We expect you to speak with your tutor about your proposed JS element(s)
							  so that you can determine whether your proposed JS addition is ‘right-sized’ for this
							  assignment part.</p>
							
							<h4 style="color:red;">2.4b Well written Javascript (optional INSTEAD of 2.4a) </h4>
							
							<p style="color:red;">The javascript code needs to be functional, well structured, properly commented, and
							  clearly indented. </p>
							
							<h3>2.5 More active participation</h3>
							
							<p>Links to two more Piazza posts go here.</p>
							
							<p></p>
							<hr>
							
							<h2 id="part3">3.0 Part 3 Tasks </h2>
							
							<h3>3.1 Provide a reflective "About my site" page </h3>
							
							<p>This should be a couple of paragraphs reflecting on what you have learnt
							about website design while actually doing it. E.g. are there things which if
							you had realised earlier you would have done different? </p>
							
							<h3>3.2 Provide an alternative CSS page </h3>
							
							<p>Create at least one extra CSS page which transforms the appearance of your
							website, either in an interesting way or into a more printer-friendly format.
							</p>
							
							<h3>3.3 Provide a Social Networking button </h3>
							
							<p>Your site could do with more exposure, or at least once you release it into
							the wild beyond the ANU limited space of partch/liskov. Please provide a
							working button for a social networking or similar site such as done in the lab
							or lecture related to this topic. If your theme is such that none of this is
							relevant then please link to this from your assignment.html file, and of course
							mention why it was not relevant for you. </p>
							
							<h3 style="color:red;">3.4 Provide a Social Networking feed(s) </h3>
							
							<p style="color:red;">Please provide a working social networking feed you have learnt about in the relevant lab.
							  If your theme is such that none of this is relevant then please email me and we may
							  be able to negotiate the alternative (make sure you keep the email in which I agree to your
							  alternative topic). </p>
							
							<h3>3.5 Validate your CSS and your HTML pages </h3>
							
							<p>Run your CSS and HTML pages through the W3C validation service. Create a
							page (or another photo gallery) showing some screenshots (if you're not sure
							how to take screenshots - google it) of the validation report. If you need to
							leave some validation errors to achieve the look you want, make a comment in
							your assignment.html file to explain.</p>
							
							<h3>3.6 Provide something original </h3>
							
							<p>Get creative and add a component or content which differs from the tasks
							listed above. It might be an extra page presenting some interesting content you
							made or wrote yourself, or which provides links to sites you have found useful
							while making the site, or which are about related or relevant subjects. or it
							might be something made with a tool you have researched and learnt to use
							yourself. Don't get stressed - this is meant to allow you to be creative in
							some way, and get marks for it. </p>
							
							<p></p>
							<hr>

							<h2 id=3D"part4">4.0 Report (detailed instructions)</h2>

							<p>In the process of developing an interactive computer system, which inclu=
								des
								web development, it is essential to conduct user evaluations of those sy=
								stems.
								In the activities for this report task you will be involved as a partici=
								pant
								in two or more experiments that add up to 3 hours. All the experiments f=
								rom Computer Science or from
								Psychology have strong similarities with the types of user evaluations t=
								hat
								you would conduct for your web development. When you take part in these
								experiments you are expected to treat them as learning exercises for you=
								rself.
								You will pay attention to the purpose of the experiment, you will observ=
								e what
								it is like to participate in that experiment, you will think critically =
								about
								the way the experiment is conducted and you will reflect on what you can=
								learn
								from that experiment that might be relevant to user evaluations of web p=
								ages
								and web sites. </p>
							<p> Writing the report will give you practice in formal writing
								about your observations, experience and reflections of taking part in th=
								ese
								experiments. In the report, you will choose two experiments that you hav=
								e participated in, and write in detail about the two experiments.
								There are two main kinds of experiments: a) where you participate and do
								tasks and will provide data which the experimenter can compare to result=
								s
								from other participants, and b) where you act like an experimenter for a=
								t
								least part of an experiment, and you explicitly compare two or more
								devices/images/videos/events/etc. The two tasks you describe in the repo=
								rt
								must include one of each of these two types of experiments.</p>


							<h3 id=3D"reportstructuretask">4.1 Structure</h3>

							<p>Your report should contain these components:</p>

							<p><u>A title and your name.</u></p>

							<p><u>Abstract:</u> This will typically be one paragraph that says what the=
								report is,
								why it was written and what it is about. Write this abstract last so that =
								it
								actually matches what is in the report.
							</p>

							<p><u>Introduction:</u> This will be slightly more detailed than the Abstr=
								act.
								It will explain what the report is about, it will list the experiments in
								which you took part and it will summarise the contents of the report.
								Proof-read this introduction when you have finished writing the report to
								make sure it actually matches what is in the report.
							</p>

							<p><u>First Experiment*: </u> This has three sub-sections.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Summarise the experiment. Here you describe the purpose of the
									experiment and describe what you were asked to do. Refer to the
									Information Sheet that the experimenters will have given you.</li>
								<li>Describe your experience of taking part in the experiment.
									Were you asked to do mechanical tasks or were you asked to
									be an intelligent participant? Did you enjoy taking part
									in the experiment? Did you find the experiment difficult
									or easy? Did you understand what you were asked to do?</li>
								<li>Comment on what you thought were the strengths and weaknesses
									of the experiment. Did you think that the experiment actually
									met the aims that were stated in the Information Sheet? Was
									the experiment well-conducted or was it chaotic and confusing?
									Did you think that the data the experimenters were gathering
									was reliable?</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							<p><u>Second Experiment*:</u> Also three sub-sections, like the first expe=
								riment.
							</p>
							<p><u>Comparison of the two Experiments: </u> Describe in what ways the two
								experiments (and your participation in them) were similar or different.
								Compare how you felt about taking part in each of the experiments.
								Compare how well you thought the two experiments were run.
							</p>
							<p><u>Relevance of user-participation experiments to web design and develop=
									ment:</u>
								Discuss what your experience of taking part in these experiments implies
								for the relevance of user-participation experiments in web design. The
								broad computer science area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) includes
								web design and user-evaluation experiments (similar to the experiments i=
								n
								which you took part) are really important in the HCI development process=
								.
								You might like to look for material about user-evaluation in HCI on the
								web or in text books and include it in this discussion. Be sure to cite
								any material that you refer to and include that material in your referen=
								ce
								list in the last section of your report.
							</p>
							<p><u>References: </u> In this section you list any documents or web pages =
								that you
								referred to in the body of the report. Be sure to list every item that =
								you
								refer to (including the Information Sheets that the experimenters give y=
								ou)
								and be sure to refer in your report to every item in this list of refere=
								nces.
							</p>

							Your report will typically be 3-4 A4 pages, using a 12-point font and
							approximately 2 centimetre margins. Use headings and sub-headings to
							give visual structure to the report. Break your text into paragraphs,
							where each paragraph focuses on a particular item or concept. Put page
							numbers in the footer of your report.

							<h3>4.3 Provide a link to your report file </h3>

							<p>You should upload your report as PDF document to your partch public_html
								folder, name it u1234567-report1710.pdf (use your UniID instead of u1234567=
								),
								and put in a link to it from your assignment.html file so we can find it.
								Do check that link to make sure the file is readable via a web browser.</p>

							<p>* In this section, we mention participation in experiments, but we also =
								say
								that this is not necessary. The alternative is to read papers we give you: =
								the
								Wattle course page will list two papers you can read, for the primary and
								secondary experiments. You thus write the report by imagining you were
								participating in the primary experiment, or in the secondary experiment. So=
								,
								you can:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>report on participation in two experiments,</li>
								<li>or report on participation in an experiment and read a paper for the
									other kind of experiment (and write up by summarising and imagining wha=
									t
									it would have been like),</li>
								<li>or read the papers instead for both kinds of experiments (and summari=
									se
									and compare the two papers).</li>
							</ul>
							Most people find that reporting on experiments is much easier than reading
							and summarising the papers.<p></p>

							<p>Most important: don't get stressed, its not too hard, we won't mark too
								hard. But do try and write clearly.</p>

							<p></p>

							<h2>Submission </h2>

							<p>If you need to apply for an extension you should contact me and explain =
								your
								situation <em>before</em> the deadline (e-mail is best). I am quite reasona=
								ble
								about extensions for unforseen circumstances. I am not allowed to give
								extensions for you having too many assignments at the same time, as that is
								considered *not* unforeseen by the School.</p>

							<p></p>
							<hr>

							<h2>Submission Methods </h2>

							<p>I am looking at a better solution for submission and marking. So this
								section may be replaced - if so, I will change this document and also send =
								an
								email to all of you explaining the change. (Make sure your ANU
								u1234567@anu.edu.au redirects to an email that you read regularly.) </p>

							<p>In addition to the instructions below, detailed step-by-step instruction=
								s
								have been provided in Wattle in the documents for Lab 1 (Assignment - De=
								tailed
								Instructions for submitting files). </p>
							<ul>
								<li>You must place it into the public directory (folder) provided in your
									RSCS account, called public_html (don't change the name of the folder o=
									r it
									will not work). Files in this folder are visible to users on the ANU
									intranet (but not to users on the wider Internet). <br>
									<br>

													<ol>
														<li>The simplest way to copy your assignment files into your
															<strong>public_html</strong> is to go to the CSIT building,
															login to your account and copy them from a USB memory stick=
															.
															Login first, and only then plugin your USB as occasionally
															there are glitches if you plugin before login. Once you hav=
															e
															done this, proceed to step 4 for advice on setting access
															permissions. <br>
														</li>
														<p></p>
														<li><a name=3D"rsync">To copy files remotely from a Mac compu=
																ter
																into your <strong>public_html</strong> directory, open the
																Terminal application and shift to the directory containing =
																the
																file/s (for eg <em>myfile.zip</em>). Some useful commands t=
																o
																help you do this are: </a>
															<ul>
																<li>Use the <strong>ls</strong> command to list the conte=
																	nts
																	of the current directory.</li>
																<li>Use the <strong>cd</strong> command to change directo=
																	ries
																	(for example, <strong>cd Desktop</strong> to shift to t=
																	he
																	Desktop sub-directory, or <strong>cd ..</strong> to mov=
																	e up
																	a level. (Tip: you can also drag a folder from Mac's Fi=
																	nder
																	application into the terminal window, this will paste t=
																	he
																	address of that folder into the terminal line.)</li>
															</ul>
															<br>
															Once you have made it to the directory where your assignmen=
															t is
															located, you can then use the secure copy command
															<strong>scp</strong> to copy your file/s across to your DCS
															account.<br>
															<br>
															For example, to copy a zip file (e.g. myfile.zip) from the =
															local directory to a directory (e.g. public_html) in your DCS account:
															<pre>      scp myfile.zip u1234567@partch.anu.edu.au:public=
	_html/
									</pre>
															To copy all the files and subdirectories in the current loc=
															al
															directory to a directory (e.g. public_html) in your DCS acc=
															ount:
															<pre>      scp -r * u1234567@partch.anu.edu.au:public_html/=
	</pre>
															<br>
															Alternatively, you can use <strong>rsync</strong>:
															<pre>      rsync  -avuz u1234567@partch.anu.edu.au:public_h=
	tml/</pre>
															<br>
															<em>Windows users</em> can use Putty (do a google search
															"download putty") for ssh connection, and PSCP or WinSCP
															instead of scp. <br>
														</li>
														<p></p>
														<li>To connect to your DCS account from a Mac run the Termina=
															l
															application OR on Windows run Putty, and type in (replacing
															<tt>u1234567</tt> with your Uni ID):
															<pre>      ssh  u1234567@partch.anu.edu.au</pre>
															and answer "yes" to the access question (asks the first tim=
															e
															only) and type in your password. Upon logging in, you can
															navigate to your /public directory using <strong>cd</strong=>
																command:
																<pre>      cd public_html</pre>
																<br>
																Then you can check the files are there by using the command=
																:
																<pre>      ls -l</pre>
														</li>
														<p></p>
														<li>The final stage is to check that your work is visible on =
															the
															ANU web (replacing <tt>u1234567</tt> with your Uni ID):
															<pre>      http://partch.anu.edu.au/~<tt>u1234567</tt></pre=
	>
									<br>
									Your index.html page should immediately appear! If your web=
	site
									does not appear, you have done something wrong; the three m=
	ost
									common problems are: <br>
									<br>

									<ul>
										<li>You have forgotten to provide an index.html file, per=
	haps
											naming it home.html or main.html or Index.html instead.=
	 Change the name.
											You can us the mv command, e.g.:
											<pre>      mv main.html index.html
											</pre>
														</li>
														<li>You have copied your assignment across as a zip file,=
															but
															forgotten to unzip the contents for use. Use
															<strong>ssh</strong> to enter the
															<strong>public_html</strong> directory as explained abo=
															ve,
															and the <strong>unzip</strong> command to unzip the
															contents, eg:
															<pre>      unzip myfile.zip
											</pre>
														</li>
														<li>If you receive a 'file not accessible' message, it me=
															ans
															that the permissions of the files and folders in your
															public_html directory are current set to "non-readable"=
															. To
															change the permissions use <strong>ssh</strong> to ente=
															r
															your <strong>public_html</strong> directory, the <stron= g>ls
																-l </strong> command to see what the current permisions=
																are
																and then run the <strong>chmod</strong> command. You ne=
																ed
																to change the permissions of the files and any
																subdirectories you, do this by typing:
																<pre>      chmod -R o+r *
											</pre>
																Be sure to run the <strong>ls -l </strong> command agai=
																n to
																check to see if the permissions have changed. Now the e=
																ighth letter of
																the permission string (something similar to <tt>-rwxr--=
																	r--</tt>)
																should be <tt>r</tt>.
														</li>
														<br>
														Please note that the web pages will be visible only withi=
														n
														the ANU intranet. If you want them view them externally y=
														ou
														need to use the <a href=3D"http://virtual.anu.edu.au/logi= n">ANU
															Reverse Proxy Service</a>. (So you will need to find anot=
														her
														place to host your site if you want to show it off to the
														world!) <br>
														<br>
							</ul>
							Don't forget to check that your assignment.html file is
							visible:
							<pre>      http://partch.anu.edu.au/~<tt>u1234567</tt>/assi=
	gnment.html</pre>
							<br>
							If you assignment.html page does not appear, check the

							<h2>Assessment and Late Penalties </h2>

							<p>Each part will be marked separately and marks will be allocated in the
								following way: </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Assignment Part 1 is worth 10 marks</li>
								<li>Assignment Part 2 is worth 10 marks</li>
								<li>Assignment Part 3 is worth 10 marks</li>
								<li>The Report is worth 15 marks</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>What will gain (or lose) you marks in the assignment? </h3>

							<h4>50% of your assignment mark will depend on consistency: </h4>
							<ul>
								<li>How thoroughly you deliver the requirements listed above.</li>
							</ul>

							<h4>50% of your assignment mark will depend on coherence and quality: </h4>
							<ul>
								<li>How coherent your site is in terms of its stated theme.</li>
								<li>The quality of your presentation:
									<ul>
										<li>Visually. </li>
										<li>Textually (good english/netlish). </li>
										<li>The design does not interfere with the message, or detract from t=
											he
											meaning. </li>
										<li>The site's readability is good across a wide range of window size=
											s
											and screen resolutions. </li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>The quality of your HTML, CSS and commenting, for eg:
									<ul>
										<li>Content and presentation are clearly separated into HTML and CSS.
										</li>
										<li>The code is well structured. </li>
										<li>The code complies with W3C standards. </li>
										<li>Indentation and commenting have been used to good effect. </li>
										<li>The structure and names of folders and files are simple, clear an=
											d
											meaningful. </li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>The creativity of your content and presentation.</li>
								<li>Any additional work or research you put into the site.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>What will gain (or lose) you marks in the report? </h3>

							<p>The report is worth 15 marks towards your course's grade and the report
								will be marked in units of half a mark.</p>

							<p>The Abstract, Introduction and the sections covering the first and
								second experiment will together be worth 7 marks.</p>

							<p>The comparison of the two experiments and your discussion of the
								relevance of user-participation experiments in web design will together
								be worth 7 marks.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Your own reflections and conclusions from participation in experiment=
									s /
									reading papers.</li>
								<li>The quality of your writing:
									<ul>
										<li>Coherence - do your paragraphs combine to "tell a story" about yo=
											ur
											experience in experiments? (Or your summarisation of papers.) </li>
										<li>Textually (good english/coherent narrative within sections and
											between sections). </li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>The reflection on your experiment participation.
									<ul>
										<li>What was it like? </li>
										<li>Did you learn anything? </li>
										<li>Did you enjoy it or hate it? Why did you feel that way? Does this
											suggest any conclusions?</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Your conclusion about the relationship of web design and human comput=
									er
									interaction.</li>
								<li>For both the reflection and conclusion:
									<ul>
										<li>There are no right or wrong opinions, there are just well express=
											ed
											and argued opinions, and badly expressed or unclear opinions.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

							<p>The overall structure of the report will be worth 1 mark.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The structure of your report includes:
									<ul>
										<li>Using all the sections a report normally contains such as Abstrac=
											t,
											Introduction, and so on. </li>
										<li>Textual quality (good english/citing references). </li>
										<li>Using some visual content, not just words (a picture is worth a
											thousand words ...). </li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>

							<p>Any additional work or research you put into the assignment or report ma=
								y
								gain you marks to compensate for missed marks in other areas.</p>

							<p>Late assessments (assignments and report) will be penalised at the rate =
								of
								one (1) mark per day, or part thereof, that the assessments is overdue.
								Assessments more than seven (7) days late will not be accepted. If you have=
								an
								extension then its not late until that extension is over. </p>

							<p></p>
							<hr>

							<h2>Tips </h2>

							<p>The assignment is not too difficult technically, but you will need to de=
								vote
								some thought to how it will all fit together. This is because your final
								product has two potentially contradictory goals. On the one hand you must
								maximise your marks by meeting all the criteria specified above, but on the
								other hand you must ensure the thematic coherence of your site. </p>

							<p>Virtually all the assignment tasks are based on your lab work (and MOOC
								materials for part 1). If a task seems unclear, check the related lab sheet
								again - I didn't want to duplicate everything in the lab sheets here so tha=
								t
								may be why the description here is short. </p>

							<p>Make sure your content is easily accessible - if the marker can't find
								something - whether one of the mandatory tasks or something special and uni=
								que
								you have made - you won't get marks for it. </p>

							<p>Lastly, an assignment checklist =E2=80=94 </p>
							<ul>
								<li>I have my own copy of everything I=E2=80=99m handing in. </li>
								<li>My assignment satisfies all the assessment criteria. </li>
								<li>It all works =E2=80=94 I=E2=80=99ve checked it in a variety of circum=
									stances.
								</li>
								<li>I=E2=80=99ve used CSS, not tables, for page layout. </li>
								<li>I=E2=80=99ve made good use of the available HTML tags to clarify the
									meaning of the content. </li>
								<li>My id and class attributes have simple, meaningful values. </li>
								<li>All my files are in the right folders and have sensible names. </li>
								<li>It=E2=80=99s going to be useful to me later. </li>
							</ul>

							<p>The report is also straightforward, but its best if you do not leave it =
								to
								the last minute. Write a draft, leave it for a day or two, and you will fin=
								d
								lots of things to improve as you will see it more like a new piece of text =
								and
								can read it more objectively. Get friends to read it and giv you comments. =
								If
								they cannot understand what its about, its time to rewrite it. </p>
